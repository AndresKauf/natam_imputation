## Scripts for Imputation project

In this repository you will find all the scripts I used to write my thesis.

There are four main steps in the analysis:

1. Creating the NATS imputation reference panel (panel_creation folder)
2. Running imputation and evaluating performance (imp_performance folder)
3. Demographic simulations (demographic_sims folder)
4. Figure creation (figure_creation folder)

Now I will detail the contents of each folder

#### Panel creation

In this folder you will find the sprits used to clean and merge the different data sources.

#### Running imputation and evaluating performance

In this folder you will find the necessary scripts for running and evaluating imputation performance using different reference panels.

#### Demographic simulations

In this folder you will find the scripts used to generate the demographic simulation data and the subsequent analysis.

#### Figure creation

In this folder you will find the scripts used to generate the figures.
